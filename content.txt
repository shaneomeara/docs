ABOUT

<h1> Shanghai's One and Only Traditional Style Barber

<p> We opened Doc Guthrie’s because we felt Shanghai needed a place where men could go and get a quick hair cut in surroundings that suited us.No pop music in the background, waiting on perms and curls and fancy hair washing to be finished. Somewhere we can go in, drink a beer or whiskey, talk shit, get a cut and leave looking better than we entered. We’re in the North Jingan area on Kangding lu, on the same block as Sailors, Sushi O, Malabar, Enoterra, and Lab. Feel free to make an appointment or just walk in.
